# Vulkan Playground
This Project was created as a playground for me to test out different Vulkan rendering techniques using Veldrid. An Open Source rendering lib written in C#. The reason why it's part of this project independently is to make compiling / using and modifyingn it easier. All licenses are unmodified and should be respected
